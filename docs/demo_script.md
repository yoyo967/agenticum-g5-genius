## 0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook & Vision

**Visuals:**

- Start on the beautiful, dark-mode `Landing Page` showing the glowing matrix.
- Scroll down slightly to show the "8 Agents" statistics.

**Script (Voiceover):**
_"We aren't building another chatbot. We're building the first Sentient Operating System for Enterprise Marketing._
_Welcome to AGENTICUM G5. Powered entirely by Google Cloud, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and the brand-new Gemini Live API._
_Instead of chatting with one AI, you speak into the void—and an entire swarm of 8 specialized agents answers._
_Let's see it in action."_

## 0:30 - 1:15 | The Live API & Voice Command

**Visuals:**

- Click "Enter OS Portal". The Global Command Console opens.
- Click the Microphone. The Audio Visualizer pulses ("LISTENING...").

**Script (Voiceover):**
_"This is the GenIUS Console. Using the bidirectional Gemini Live WebSocket, I can bypass text inputs entirely."_
_(Speaker pushes the microphone button)_
**Speaker:** _"SN-00, we need a complete launch campaign for an AI-powered CRM system targeting Enterprise SaaS. Go."_
_(Release button. The OS lights up instantly.)_
_"Zero latency. The Gemini Live API instantly parses my intent through Function Calling, and orchestrates the Swarm Protocol. Notice how all 8 agents light up in parallel—not sequentially. Real-time synergy."_

## 1:15 - 2:00 | The Specialist Nodes (Imagen 3 & Counter-Strike)

**Visuals:**

- Switch to the **Imagen Gallery** (DA-03 node). Images appear in real-time.
- Switch to the **Global Radar Console** (SP-01 Counter-Strike node).

**Script (Voiceover):**
_"While the Director node drafts the copy in the background, our DA-03 Architect node is already calling Vertex AI to generate high-fidelity visual assets using Imagen 3._
_Simultaneously, the SP-01 Strategist runs a 'Counter-Strike' analysis using our custom Columna vector database. It dynamically rips competitor topics and visualizations directly onto our Tactical Radar map. This is live data, synthesized on the fly by Gemini."_

## 2:00 - 2:30 | The Senate Node & Compliance

**Visuals:**

- Switch to the **Senate Terminal** showing the AI Act compliance checks.
- Show the **Perfect Twin Provenance** modal (Firestore sync).

**Script (Voiceover):**
_"But speed is useless without safety. This is the RA-01 Auditor—the Senate Node. Before any asset touches the outside world, it is forcefully audited against the EU AI Act (Article 50), GDPR constraints, and FTC guidelines._
_Every decision, every prompt, every asset is hashed and stored in Firestore, creating a 'Perfect Twin' audit trail. It's Enterprise-Grade compliance, built natively into the architecture."_

## 2:30 - 3:00 | Conclusion & Impact

**Visuals:**

- Navigate to the `/demo` endpoint to show the automated summary animation.
- Finish on the "Experience the OS" CTA button.

**Script (Voiceover):**
_"This is the zero-click future._
_100% Google Cloud Native. A seamless integration of the Gemini Live API, Vertex AI, Imagen 3, and Cloud Run._
_AGENTICUM G5 proves that AI is no longer just a copilot—it’s the entire agency._
_Thank you to the Google team for providing the APIs to make the future possible today."_
