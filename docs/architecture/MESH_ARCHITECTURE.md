# 🕸️ MESH ARCHITECTURE: THE 52-NODE GRID

AGENTICUM G5 GENIUS operates on a flexible, scalar mesh of **52 specialized AI nodes**. While 8 core nodes are currently active for the Global Submission, the architecture is designed to activate "Latent Nodes" as task complexity scales.

## 1. Active Swarm: The Core 8

| ID        | Name         | Role            | Core Capability                         |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **SN-00** | Orchestrator | Sovereign Logic | Multi-modal Reasoning & Intent Parsing  |
| **SO-00** | Sovereign    | Value Guard     | Strategic Vision & Brand DNA            |
| **SP-01** | Strategist   | Market Intel    | Google Search Grounding & SWOT          |
| **CC-06** | Copywriter   | Narrative       | Emotional Storytelling & Ad Copy        |
| **DA-03** | Designer     | Visual Synth    | Imagen 3 Prompt Engineering             |
| **BA-07** | Browser      | Web Agent       | Live Data Extraction & Competitive Scan |
| **VE-01** | Video        | Motion Engine   | Veo Prompting & Storyboarding           |
| **RA-01** | Senate       | Audit & Intel   | Compliance, DSGVO & Global Intel        |

## 2. Latent Mesh: The 44 Strategic Nodes

The G5 Mesh includes specialized latent nodes categorized into clusters:

### A. Intelligence Cluster (Latent)

- **MI-02**: Predictive Analytics (Fused into RA-01 for V2)
- **GI-01**: Geopolitics Node (Sovereign Mesh)
- **LI-01**: Legal Intelligence (Contract Analysis)

### B. Creative Cluster (Latent)

- **AU-01**: Audio Synthesis (Music & Soundscapes)
- **UX-01**: Interface Design (System UI Layouts)
- **TR-01**: Translation & Localization (Global Reach)

### C. Distribution Cluster (Latent)

- **OM-01**: Omni-Channel Manager (Scheduling)
- **AD-01**: Ad Spend Optimizer (FinOps)

## 3. Node Communication: The SwarmBus

Nodes communicate via the **SwarmBus Protocol**, a real-time event fabric that ensures:

1. **Shared State:** Every node knows what the others have discovered.
2. **Adversarial Audit:** RA-01 can intercept any node's output before it reaches the frontend.
3. **Synchronous Feedback:** Real-time feedback loops from the operator (Intervention).

## 4. Activation Logic: Just-In-Time Latency

Latent nodes are activated by **SN-00** based on the prompt's complexity score. If the mission requires Geopolitical context, GI-01 is "warmed up" and integrated into the current session.
