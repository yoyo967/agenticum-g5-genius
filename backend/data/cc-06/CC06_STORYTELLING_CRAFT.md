## MODULE 1: THE OGILVY PRINCIPLES — ADVERTISING CRAFT

### David Ogilvy's Commandments of Advertising
David Ogilvy founded Ogilvy & Mather, one of the most successful advertising agencies in history. His empirically derived principles remain the gold standard of persuasive copywriting.

**Principle 1: The Headline is Everything**
On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. If you haven't done a selling job in your headline, you have wasted 80% of your client's money. The headline must contain the brand promise, the key benefit, and ideally a reason to read further.

**Principle 2: Long Copy Sells**
Research consistently shows that long copy outperforms short copy for high-involvement purchases. People who are interested in your product will read every word. People who are not interested will not be helped by short copy. Write long, but make every sentence earn its place.

**Principle 3: Specificity Beats Vagueness**
Specific claims are more believable than general ones. "The Rolls-Royce at 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in the car comes from the electric clock" is remembered decades later because of its precision. Replace "excellent quality" with "backed by 5,000 hours of durability testing."

**Principle 4: News and Novelty**
The word "new" in a headline increases readership by 30–40%. Human brains are novelty-seeking machines. If there is genuine news about the product, lead with it. If the product is genuinely new, say so. Never manufacture false novelty.

**Principle 5: Research Everything**
Ogilvy was obsessive about research. Before writing a single word of copy, know: the product inside-out, every competitive alternative, the target consumer's deepest desires and frustrations. "If you're trying to persuade people to do something, or buy something, it seems to me you should use their language."

**Principle 6: Testimonials Are the Most Powerful Format**
Consumer testimonials outperform all other advertising formats for credibility. Real people, in their own words, with specific results. The more specific the testimonial, the more believable.

**Principle 7: Photographs Outperform Illustrations**
Photographs are read as reality. Illustrations are read as opinion. For product advertising, always use photography when authenticity is the goal. Use illustration when aspiration or emotion is the goal.

**Principle 8: Coupons and Direct Response Prove Your Copy Works**
Ogilvy was a pioneer of direct response. Every campaign should have a measurable response mechanism. If the copy doesn't drive action, it is decoration, not advertising.

## MODULE 2: NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE — DEEP STORYTELLING

### The Three-Act Structure in Advertising
Adapted from screenwriting for brand communication:

**Act 1 — Establish (0–15 seconds in video; opening paragraph in text)**:
- Introduce the world as it is NOW — relatable, familiar, imperfect
- Establish the character (customer) in their everyday context
- Plant the seed of the problem — not yet stated explicitly, but felt
- Goal: The viewer says "that's me"

**Act 2 — Complicate (15–45 seconds in video; body of copy)**:
- The problem fully manifests — or the opportunity becomes visible
- Introduce the tension: what is at stake if nothing changes?
- The brand enters as guide/solution — demonstrated, not claimed
- Show transformation in progress — the product at work
- Goal: The viewer says "I need that"

**Act 3 — Resolve (45–60+ seconds in video; closing copy)**:
- Show the world AFTER — the transformed state
- Deliver the emotional payoff — the feeling of success
- Call to action — specific, easy, low-risk
- Leave a resonant final image or line
- Goal: The viewer says "I'll do it"

### The 12-Beat Emotional Journey of a Great Ad

1. **Recognition**: The audience sees themselves in the character/scenario
2. **Identification**: Emotional alignment — "this brand understands me"
3. **Problem activation**: The pain/desire is made conscious
4. **Hope introduction**: A better world is implied
5. **Credibility moment**: Proof that the brand can deliver
6. **Desire amplification**: The aspirational future becomes vivid
7. **Overcoming objection**: The biggest "but what about..." is addressed
8. **Social proof**: Others like me have made this choice
9. **Decision point**: The moment of invitation to act
10. **Low-risk entry**: Make the first step feel safe
11. **Belonging signal**: Joining a community, not just buying a product
12. **Identity affirmation**: The brand purchase confirms a positive self-image

### Aristotle's Rhetorical Triangle — Applied to Copy

**Ethos (Credibility)**:
- The brand's authority to make the claim
- Built through: certifications, years in business, founder story, client roster, media coverage
- Copy that builds ethos: "For 20 years, we've helped 50,000 businesses..." / "Recommended by..."

**Pathos (Emotion)**:
- The emotional resonance of the message
- Built through: storytelling, imagery, music (video), sensory language, personal stakes
- Copy that builds pathos: "Remember the last time you felt truly confident?" / "Your daughter is watching how you handle this"

**Logos (Logic)**:
- The rational case for belief or action
- Built through: data, statistics, comparisons, demonstrations, specifications
- Copy that builds logos: "In independent testing, 9 out of 10 users reported..." / "At €0.05 per unit, it pays for itself in 3 months"

**CC-06 Directive**: Every piece of communication should contain all three. Ethos earns the right to speak. Pathos creates desire. Logos removes the final obstacle to action.

## MODULE 3: VIDEO STORYTELLING — DIRECTOR'S CRAFT

### The Grammar of Video
Understanding the visual language that communicates meaning subliminally:

**Shot Types and Meaning**:
- **Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)**: Establishes world, context, scale. Message: This is the world you live in.
- **Wide Shot (WS)**: Full character in environment. Message: Here is where they are.
- **Medium Shot (MS)**: From waist up. Message: Natural conversation distance. Trust.
- **Close-Up (CU)**: Face or object. Message: This detail matters. Intimacy, intensity.
- **Extreme Close-Up (ECU)**: Eyes, lips, texture. Message: Emotion, sensory experience.
- **Over-the-Shoulder (OTS)**: Point-of-view implication. Message: You are in the scene.

**Camera Movement and Meaning**:
- **Push in (dolly/zoom toward subject)**: Increasing intensity, revelation, importance
- **Pull out**: Isolation, context expansion, emotional distance
- **Pan**: Revealing the world, following action, pointing direction
- **Tilt up**: Aspiration, elevation, triumph
- **Tilt down**: Grounding, revelation of detail, gravity
- **Handheld/shaky**: Reality, authenticity, documentary truth
- **Steadicam (smooth tracking)**: Grace, confidence, aspiration

**Editing Rhythm and Message**:
- **Slow cut rate (3–5 second cuts)**: Premium, contemplative, luxury, emotional
- **Fast cut rate (0.5–1.5 second cuts)**: Energy, excitement, youth, urgency
- **Match cuts**: Connecting two disparate worlds — the old and new, problem and solution
- **J-cuts and L-cuts**: Audio leads or trails video — creates fluidity, pulls viewer forward

### The 4-Minute Demo Video Framework (Hackathon + Pitch Format)
For maximum impact in limited time:

**0:00–0:30 — The Hook (Problem Story)**
Open on a vivid, specific scenario of the problem. No brand intro yet. The viewer must feel the pain before they can appreciate the solution. Use a close-up human face or an evocative situation. No logos. No voice-over branding. Just truth.

**0:30–1:00 — The World Before**
Contrast — show the frustration, the inefficiency, the cost of the current state. Be specific. Not "marketing is hard" but "you spent 3 weeks and €15,000 on a campaign that generated zero qualified leads."

**1:00–2:00 — The Solution in Action**
Live demonstration. Real product, real results. No Mockups. No "coming soon." Show the product working right now. Voice-over narrates the specific feature benefits while the visual shows them in action.

**2:00–3:00 — The Architecture Moment**
Explain how it works — briefly, clearly, without jargon. Architecture diagram if relevant. Voice-over: "Here's why this works differently."

**3:00–3:30 — The Proof**
The result. Quantified outcome. Client testimonial if possible. Before/after comparison if relevant.

**3:30–4:00 — The Invitation**
One clear call to action. What do you want the viewer to do? One answer. Clean visual. Memorable closing line. End on emotion, not information.

## MODULE 4: COPYWRITING FORMULAS — THE TOOLKIT

### AIDA — The Classic Conversion Formula
- **A**ttention: Stop the scroll. Create pattern interruption.
- **I**nterest: Engage with relevant benefit or intriguing insight.
- **D**esire: Amplify want by showing a vivid better future.
- **A**ction: Ask for one specific, low-risk next step.

### PAS — The Pain Amplification Formula
- **P**roblem: Name the problem precisely and specifically.
- **A**gitate: Deepen the pain. What does this problem cost? What does it prevent?
- **S**olve: Introduce the solution as the logical resolution of the amplified pain.

### The Four U's Headline Formula (American Writers & Artists)
Every great headline should be:
- **U**seful: Offers benefit or value to the reader
- **U**ltra-specific: Contains a specific detail that increases credibility
- **U**rgent: Creates a reason to read now, not later
- **U**nique: Says something that hasn't been said before

### The FAB Conversion Formula
- **F**eatures: What the product has or does
- **A**dvantages: Why the feature is better than the alternative
- **B**enefits: What this means for the customer's life — the emotional payoff

**CC-06 Directive**: Never present a feature without its benefit. Customers don't buy features — they buy the feelings those features produce.

## MODULE 5: SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT ARCHITECTURE

### Platform-Specific Content Principles

**Instagram (Visual Platform)**:
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (feed), 9:16 (Stories/Reels), 4:5 (feed portrait)
- First 3 seconds of video determine whether someone watches or scrolls
- Captions should be front-loaded: the most important word comes first
- Hashtags: 5–10 highly relevant > 30 generic
- Single strong visual idea — not multi-message

**TikTok (Native Authenticity Platform)**:
- Native, raw, unpolished aesthetic outperforms produced content
- Hook in the first 1.5 seconds or lose the viewer permanently
- Trending audio dramatically increases organic reach
- Subtitles are essential — 85% of TikTok users watch without sound
- Duet and Stitch features extend reach through collaboration

**LinkedIn (Professional Credibility Platform)**:
- Lead with a single bold insight or counterintuitive claim
- Long-form personal narrative outperforms corporate messaging
- Images with people receive 3× more engagement than graphics
- Native video uploaded directly outperforms YouTube links
- Engagement in first 90 minutes determines algorithmic reach

**YouTube (Long-form Discovery Platform)**:
- Thumbnail + Title determines 80% of click-through rate
- Thumbnail: one face, one emotion, one text, high contrast
- Title: front-load the most searchable keyword; create curiosity or promise value
- Retention at the 30% mark determines YouTube promotion
- End screens and cards are essential for channel growth

## MODULE 6: SCRIPTWRITING — VOICE, TONE AND DIALOGUE

### Writing Voice-Over Copy
Voice-over copy is not read — it is heard. The rules are different from print:

- **Write for the ear**: Shorter sentences. Contractions. Everyday words.
- **Read it aloud**: If you stumble, the voice artist will stumble. Rewrite.
- **Avoid consecutive consonant clusters**: "statistics substantiating systematic success" is a tongue-twister.
- **1 main idea per sentence**: Complex sentences confuse listeners.
- **120 words per minute**: The standard pace for natural spoken English. A 60-second script should contain approximately 120 words. A 30-second script: 75 words.
- **Pause on purpose**: Strategic silence is as powerful as words. "Imagine [pause] what that would mean for your business."

### Dialogue Writing — Brand Characters and Testimonials
- Real dialogue sounds fragmented and imperfect. "Well, I was thinking... you know what I mean?" is more credible than perfect sentences.
- People do not describe their own emotions directly. They describe situations and let the viewer feel the emotion.
- Avoid brand names and product names in dialogue — it sounds scripted and destroys credibility.
- The best testimonials are not about the product at all — they are about how life has changed.
